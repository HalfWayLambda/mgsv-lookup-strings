Cashmere wool, the luxury material known worldwide for its softness and heat retention, is spun from the small amounts of down within this outer layer of wool.
A strain of sheep with its origins in Central Asian regions, including Uzbekistan and Afghanistan. The world's oldest breed of domesticated sheep, the wool of its lambs is highly prized as a luxury material. Can store fat in its tail as a camel does in its hump. This is said to be the reason for its remarkable resistance to starvation and drought.
A subfamily of rodents distributed across Central Eurasia and Africa. Many live in arid regions like deserts, savannahs, and wastelands, and the Mongolian gerbil in particular is in high demand as a pet. The fact that they perspire very little and can condense water from their urine before excretion is said to contribute to their hardiness in dry areas.
A subspecies of the brown bear native to the Himalayan area. Some are whitish in color compared to other brown bears. Due to the decline in its numbers in the wild, it is known as the \
A type of chameleon native to arid regions from Angola to South Africa. Unlike most chameleons it lives on the ground, to which it has adapted by evolving a distinctive chubby body and short tail.
