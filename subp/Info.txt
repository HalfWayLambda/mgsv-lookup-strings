SubTool
subp_dictionary.txt - Default dictionary
StrCode32 of subtitleId
Currently just Tpp dictionary.

subp_dictionary_HashStringMatches.txt - useful for figuring out what the discovered string was when you have only the hash (you have a file from older dictionary).

SubTool outputs .subp.xml
Id key is subtitleId StrCode32 hash. Naming is legacy from when tool was created. Leaving as-is to not break any existing worked on .subp.xml (I think there's some translation projects out there).

Output dictionary of current set of strings in subp_dictionary-test has been manually edited to remove a few incorrect matches, others seem right but haven't been exhaustively checked.

Many of the subp id strings are in the wem files inside sbp archives (as uppercase vs the hashed lowercase versions)
